    "The Justice Equity Need Index (JENI), by Advancement Project California, offers a means to map out the disparate burden that criminalization and a detention-first justice model place on specific communities. The index includes the following indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "System Involvement: The system-involved population by ZIP Code results in direct needs for justice equity, as measured by adult and youth probation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicators: Adult Probation (per 1,000 people); Youth Probation (per 1,000 people)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inequity Drivers: Root inequities across communities that contribute to racial and economic disparities as seen in incarceration and policing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicators: Black, Latinx, AIAN, and NHPI Percentages of Population (average percentile); Unemployment Rate (%); Population aged 25+ without a High School Diploma (%); Population below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (%); Violent Crime Rate (per 1,000 people)\n",
    "\n",
    "Criminalization Risk: Conditions where the criminal justice system has historically taken a detention-first, prevention-last approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicators: Mental Health Hospitalizations (per 1,000 people); Substance Use-Related Hospitalizations (per 1,000 people); Homelessness Rate (per 1,000 people)\n",
